# Scrabble.java
- This is my first coding project, done in my first semester for the "programming fundamentals" class. 
- Java was the first programming language that I learned, and this project the first big challenge that I faced in my coding careeer.
At the moment, dealing with binary search, matrixes, a graphical interface and a 100'000 words dictionary was a really big challange considering the deadline.
This may be not much, but I store it in the buttom of my heart.
- Well documented code, Javadocs available
